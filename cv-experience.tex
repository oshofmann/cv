    \begin{innerlist}
        \item TxLinux 2.6 
        \begin{innerlist}
           \item Worked on team to develop TxLinux, the first operating system
to use hardware transactional memory for synchronization
           \item Designed and implemented \emph{cooperative transactional
spinlocks}, forming the basis for large-scale automatic conversion of the
Linux kernel to use hardware transactions
           \item Published in ISCA '07 and SOSP '07
        \end{innerlist}
        \item TxLinux 2.4
        \begin{innerlist}
           \item Applied techniques from TxLinux 2.6 to Linux 2.4 to
demonstrate the benefit of hardware transactional memory for
improving coarse-grained synchronization performance in the operating
system
           \item Introduced \emph{transaction ordering}, a novel technique for
unifying hardware and software transactional memory in user applications
           \item Published in ASPLOS '09
        \end{innerlist}
        \item TxOS
        \begin{innerlist}
           \item Worked on team to develop TxOS, a version of Linux
providing \emph{system transactions} to ensure atomic, isolated and
consistent updates to diverse system resources
           \item Modified the ext3 file system to provide durable
transactional updates
           \item Published in SOSP '09
        \end{innerlist}
        \item Unvanish
        \begin{innerlist}
           \item Identified vulnerabilities in the Vanish system for
self-destructing data
           \item Designed and implemented Unvanish, a system to recover
data protected by Vanish
           \item Published in NDSS '10
         \end{innerlist}
         \item OSck
         \begin{innerlist}
            \item Designed and implemented a system for efficient
hypervisor-based kernel rootkit detection based on the Linux KVM hypervisor
            \item Published in ASPLOS '11
         \end{innerlist}
         \item InkTag
         \begin{innerlist}
            \item Designed and implemented InkTag, a hypervisor-based system
for securely executing applications under an untrusted operating system
            \item To appear in ASPLOS '13
         \end{innerlist}
    \end{innerlist}
